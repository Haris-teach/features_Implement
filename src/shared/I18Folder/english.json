  "Para": "Sriwijaya Air flight SJ182 was a domestic flight from Jakarta Soekarnoâ€“Hatta International Airport (CGK) to Pontianak Supadio International Airport (PNK). It was operated by a 26-year old Boeing 737-500 registered PK-CLC. This aircraft has been with the airline since 2012, having previously flown for US carriers Continental and United. \n\n\n Data from tracking website FlightRadar24.com suggests that it had reached almost 11,000 feet on its climb northwards over the Java Sea, before losing almost all of this height within a minute. Radar contact was lost at 07:40 UTC, or 14:40 local time, when the aircraft was at an altitude of just 250 feet."
